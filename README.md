# Robust Structure Identification and Room Segmentation of Cluttered Indoor Environments from Occupancy Grid Maps 	

## Overview

ROSE^2 is a method for RObust StructurE identification and ROom SEgmentation of 2D occupancy maps, which may be cluttered and incomplete. It identifies the main directions of walls and is resilient to clutter and partial observations, allowing to extract a clean, abstract geometrical  floor-plan-like description of the environment, which is used to segment, i.e., to identify rooms in, the original occupancy grid map.
This repository is a fixed up, ready to use version of the code provided in the github repo - https://github.com/goldleaf3i/declutter-reconstruct/tree/master and should be used with the code provided by [ROSE](https://github.com/tkucner/rose). I have patched up all the code level issues from the main github repo. Sorry for not adding the requirements.txt file for the same.
